# Hello-World-2
Bored with D2 but interested in how bots operate, thus I discovered Github
I played the diablo 1 when launched in 96, then in 2001 I went into D2. When my sons got old enough I connected our computers and we played together. Mid last year I tried D3 and disliked so I began D2 again and quickly learned how it seems everyone is using a bot. After a while I thought I would learn how that worked since I enjoy learning. That brought me to Github!
